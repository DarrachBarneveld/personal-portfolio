        After graduating with a degree in <strong>Science</strong>, I decided to
        travel the world and found myself working in digital marketing for
        years. However during the pandameic I discovered a passion for
        programming and in late 2022 decided to take things more serious.{" "}

      <p className="mb-3">
        I enrolled in a coding bootcamp and learned{" "}
        <strong>full-stack web development</strong>.{" "}
        <em>My favourite part of programming</em> is the problem-solving aspect.
        I <span className="underline">love</span> the feeling of finally
        figuring out a solution to a problem. My core stack is{" "}
        <strong>React, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB</strong> though I also love{" "}
        <strong>Django and Django rest framework</strong>. I am always looking
        to for new projects to build to enhance my skills. I am currently
        looking for a <strong>full-time position</strong> as a software
        developer.

        <em>When I&apos;m not coding</em>, I enjoy playing chess, watching
        movies, going for long walks in nature. I also enjoy learning about{" "}
        <strong>history and philosophy</strong>. Sometimes I believe myself to
        be musically challanged but with the right{" "}
